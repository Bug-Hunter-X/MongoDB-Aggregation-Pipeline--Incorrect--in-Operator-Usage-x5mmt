# MongoDB Aggregation Pipeline: Incorrect $in Operator Usage
This repository demonstrates a common error when using the `$in` operator within MongoDB's aggregation pipeline. The incorrect usage can lead to unexpected query results or errors.  The solution provides the correct syntax, highlighting the importance of proper string handling and operator usage.

## Bug Description:
The original code incorrectly uses the `$in` operator when querying for string values within a MongoDB aggregation pipeline.  Failure to enclose string values in double quotes leads to unexpected results.

## Solution:
The corrected code showcases the proper syntax for using the `$in` operator.  Ensuring that string values are enclosed in double quotes prevents unexpected query outcomes.

## How to Reproduce the Bug:
1.  Insert several documents into your MongoDB collection.
2.  Execute the incorrect aggregation pipeline code against the collection.
3.  Observe the unexpected results. Then compare them with the correct implementation.
